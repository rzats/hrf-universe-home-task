This is an overview of my solution - the original task specifications have been moved to the `TASK.md` file.

## 1. Create a table in the database to store "days to hire" statistics. 

This uses the column names mentioned elsewhere in the task specifications:
- `min_days`
- `avg_days`
- `max_days`
- `job_postings_number`
Otherwise it is self-explanatory.
